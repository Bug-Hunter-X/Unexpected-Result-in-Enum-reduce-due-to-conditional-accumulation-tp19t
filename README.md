This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Elixir's `Enum.reduce` when dealing with conditional accumulation. The provided code intends to sum only elements greater than 3, but it omits elements that don't satisfy the condition. This can lead to unexpected results and potentially errors in more complex scenarios.  The solution demonstrates a safer and more expressive way to achieve conditional summation.
